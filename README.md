# loggingFramework

This is designed to log variables in real time and then when requested print them on the serial bus in CSV format.

At that point using copy paste the data, can be visualised in your viewer of choice.
This step could be automated at some point.

Any tabular program like excel will work, but I use specific graphing program like Flow CSV viewer.

Note, it can only take strings, so you need to convert whatever you want to log to a string first.
